            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Connor Burns and I am currently a Junior at UCF pursuing a degree in Digital Media with the
                track
                of Web Development with a minor in Marketing. Other than school I also have two dogs and a cat at
                home. My dogs names are Marley and Lola and the cat's name is Puff.
                This site will give you more of an insight to me and to who I am. </p>

            <h1>Before College</h1>
            <p>I went to high school in Gainesville, Florida which is two hours north of Orlando. While there I played
                on
                the lacrosse team as the goalie which I found out is
                one of the hardest positions to play in sports and actually was named best goalie in the area and led
                our
                team to our first ever district championship against a top 10 team in the state.
                I eventually applied to UCF as it was my first choice and after months of waiting I was accepted to the
                2017
                term.</p>

            <h1>College</h1>
            <p>I started here at UCF in 2017 as a game design major as originally that was what I wanted to do but
                eventually I decided to change paths and switch to web design. So far I have really enjoyed the
                web design track and have met some really great people as well as having really good teachers. Outside
                of
                class I enjoy working out and playing sports. My friends and I play intramural flag football
                each semester so it keeps us in some type of sport and keeps us all active. I still do get to play
                lacrosse
                in the summer at a men's league tournament which is a ton of fun. Other than sports and working out I am
                an
                avid video game player my main game at the moment has been Rainbow Six: Siege but my all time favorite
                is Borderlands 2. </p>

            <p>I have also decided to add two pics of our past dogs since they were around my entire life up to freshman
                year of college, so how could I leave them out.</p>
